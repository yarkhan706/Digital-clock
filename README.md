# Clock Web App

This is a simple web app that displays the current date and time. The app updates the time every second to provide an accurate representation.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The web page will show a container with the current date and time.
3. The date is displayed in the format "Weekday, Month Day, Year" (e.g., "Tuesday, July 20, 2023").
4. The time is shown in the format "HH:mm:ss" (e.g., "12:30:45").

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the clock layout and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the clock container and date/time display.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file with the logic to update the date and time.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the clock and date elements by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. Additionally, you can modify the JavaScript logic in the `index.js` file to adjust the clock's behavior.
